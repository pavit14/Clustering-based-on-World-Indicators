# Clustering-based-on-World-Indicators
This project aims to cluster countries based on their socio-economic indicators using the K-means clustering algorithm. The analysis is performed on a real-life World Bank Indicators dataset, which contains a variety of socio-economic indicators for countries around the world.

Understanding the socio-economic development of countries is crucial for making informed decisions in fields such as international development and global economics. This project aims to provide valuable insights into country clustering based on their socio-economic indicators using data-driven methods.

## Features
* Imported a real-life World indicator of countries in the United States dataset and prepared it for analysis by cleaning data
working with Python numpy, pandas library and normalized data
* Observed number of clusters by employing Elbow Method, Silhouette Score and Calinski-Harabasz Index, clustered
countries based on K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering methods and visualized it via scatterplot

## Libraries
* pandas
* sklearn
* numpy
* matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
* seaborn

## Results
The clustering results can provide insights into the socio-economic development of different countries. The scatter plot can be used to identify clusters of countries that have similar socio-economic indicators. The results can be used to support decision-making in fields such as international development and global economics
